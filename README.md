## Project Description
- This project aims to explore the state of the film industry around the globe, by making visualizations in D3. This was motivated by our shared interest in movies, and the allegedly recent decline of the American film industry compared to international films.

- This project analyzes trends in movies released, by looking at both the IMDB ratings and the box office revenue for each country over time. It follows a Martini Glass structure, beginning with questions before transitioning to the full dashboard for users to explore.
